#+TITLE: Stack for hosted services run from linode

* What lives here
- This is a collection of things which, for one reason or another, I didn't want to host locally on my unraid server
  - These are mostly things that I don't want to go down, that monitor other services uptime, just seemed too small for a heavy solution like unraid, or that I want the option to troubleshoot remotely if a tree hits a powerline at home while I'm out

* Blog
- In order for hugo to run, you'll need to clone a theme into the blog/themes folder
  - I'm using the [[https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal][Hugo Terminal Theme]]
    - *Make sure* that all your files get cloned into e.g. `blog/themes/terminal` and not one folder deeper or it won't work
  - Once the theme is cloned in, follow the instructions for your theme as to what needs to go in the top level config.toml file
  - Once everything is running, all your posts should be able to go to blog/content/posts
- TODO How to store posts in a separate repo? Or maybe ox-hugo lets me store them in an org directory
- TODO Ox-Hugo
- TODO Org-roam wiki export? Maybe in another container with the org roam visualizer

* TTYD
- TODO find a way to get my custom programs cloned in here and updated remotely

** Initial Setup
- Default user: admin@example.com
- Default password: Changeme
** Managing SSL
